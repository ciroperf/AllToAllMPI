# AllToAll

In this project will be shown some algorithms that perform the operation of the AllToAll operation using the OpenMPI library. The algorithm were taken from scientific papers that have already dealt with the problem of optimization of the AllToAll communication.

## AllToALL Baseline

This is the baseline used to check the performance of the algorithms. It is the function **MPI_Alltoall** already existent in the OpenMPI library.
